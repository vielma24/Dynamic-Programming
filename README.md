## Description: String matching with dynamic programming 

Algorithm Engineering project exploring the advantanges of dynamic programming when string matching, such as DNA searching/matching. Given a vector of proteins and a string to match, local_alignment_best_match function attempts to find a best fit. 

The local_alignment function uses 2-dimensional arrays to consider all plausible combinations of strings. The best match was determined using a Blosum Penalty matrix to account for variations of the substrings within the given confines.
